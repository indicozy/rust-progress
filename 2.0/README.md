Well nice, just came in and now I need to think for every line of code.
Stopped at the end of `Listing 2-4`

## NOTES
* `use std::io;` is the same as `using namespace std` in C to indicate that `io` as `std::io`
* `::` syntax in the `::new` indicates that it is an associated function of the `String` type. 
* `1..100` is the same as arr[1:100] in Python
* wow that `cargo doc --open` looks cool, check it out!

## TODO
* learn how `.read_line(&mut guess)` works
* learn what is (enumerations)[https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-00-enums.html]
