Well hello package managers (PTSD from JS...)

Some notes:
1. `cargo new` - new project
1. `cargo build` - build project
1. `cargo run` - build (if wasn't) and run the project
1. `cargo check` - check the code but don't make and executable
1. `cargo build --release` compile it with optimizations to release
