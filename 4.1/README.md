# Main
So... It was very interesting. I liked that, but it will be hard to make some notes.

## Stack vs Heap
By looking through google and stuff, Rust gave one of the most understandable explanations on what are the differences.

## Memory handling
Rust is a *not like other girls* when it comes to memory handling. It uses the term of **Ownereship**

Stacking values do copy when declared, heaps do not, they move.

Heap info is gone after used by a function, so use **Referencing instead**!

I guess it's enough to understand.
